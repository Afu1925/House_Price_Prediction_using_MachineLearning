# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning aims to build an estimation tool that predicts the approximate price of a house based on the features such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, overall scores and historical data. This project would not only provide insights for the buyers to buy a house at the relevant price but also help the sellers to price the property fairly.

## Goal
* The primary goal is to develop a Machine Learning model capable of learning patterns and relationships between various features and house price to accurately predict the approximate price of a house 
* The secondary goal is to build a reliable and user-friendly web application using Python Flask, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), JavaScript, where users would be able to enter their preferred data and receive the price estimates as a result.

## Feature
* USER ACCESSIBILITY: Model is built and integrated in a user-friendly web application where user would be able to interact with the model easily
* REAL-TIME PREDICTIONS: Users can input data and receive immediate predictions, enhancing the user experience and making decision-making faster.
* INTERACTIVE FEATURES: This application includes interactive elements, such as navbars, elements to allow users to easily see how they affect the predicted price.
* DATA VISUALIZATION: Incorporated graphs and charts which help the user to understand trends and factors influencing house prices, making the information more understandable.
* COST-EFFICIENT: Buyers can save money by having this model build as they need not be spending money on employers.
* TIME SAVING: It takes more time to predict price if it is done manually but using this model which has machine learning algorithm, it takes less time.

## Objective:
* To build an efficient model that predicts the price of the house using machine learning
* To integrate the model into the web application 
* To create engaging platform for the house price predicting users to get informed decisions.
* To improve the responsiveness of the application

## Scope:
* Integrating the house price prediction model into the web application built using Python Flask, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), JavaScript
* Displaying the predicted price in a user friendly application.
